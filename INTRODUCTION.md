## 1. A Personal Note

I understand that the initial Mamawmail submission with IFPP was purely conceptual, and many areas still need to be fleshed out. Please bear with me, as this is my **first submission of this type**, I am working solo, and my available time is limited.  

The more I examine MAMAWMAIL, the clearer its structure and potential become. I am increasingly convinced of its promise, and I have now **formalized and organized the project**.

## 2. Project Overview

The GitHub repositories have been structured as follows:

1. **ORG: Mamawmail Research Initiative**  
   - An open-ended initiative to add components, features, and contributors.  

2. **Repository 2: mamawmail-system-whitepaper**  
   - System-wide whitepaper covering AI federated learning, Path Saturation Singularity, Message Count Singularity, and overall architectural design.  

3. **Repository 1: mamawmail-intelligent-fractal-propagation-protocol**  
   - Core research and development repository for the decentralized IFPP peer-to-peer communication protocol.  
   - Contains formal documentation, simulations, and mathematical models for message propagation, delivery assurance, and network resilience.  

4. **Repository 3: mamawmail**  
   - Official implementation of the Mamawmail decentralized communication system, including Community Edition and Enterprise modules.  

> **Note:** These file structures are currently outlines and will evolve as development progresses.

## 3. Rationale for Repository Structure

Initially, IFPP research and system evaluation (e.g., gossip protocols) were considered together. After further examination, it became clear that:

- **IFPP deserves a dedicated repository** to allow detailed description, testing, and evaluation, including its own whitepaper.  
- **Mamawmail system-wide whitepaper** focuses on the implementation of IFPP, preserving clarity for AI concepts, mathematical models, and network-wide architecture.  
- **Mamawmail implementation repository** focuses on the practical, modular deployment of the system.  

This separation ensures **conceptual clarity**, **rigorous evaluation**, and ease of contribution.

---

## 4. Current Focus

- Detailed **definition, design, and evaluation of IFPP**.  
- Separation of IFPP research from system-wide concerns to ensure clarity and rigorous analysis.  
- Potential **team expansion** for unit testing, documentation, and wiki population.  

---

## 5. Next Steps

- Publish the **IFPP whitepaper** in its dedicated repository.  
- Continue refinement of the **system-wide whitepaper** for Mamawmail.  
- Develop modular implementations, diagrams, and visualizations to support both research and practical deployment.

## 6. Key Terms (Standardized)

- **IFPP (Intelligent Fractal Propagation Protocol):** Device-centric, AI-assisted peer-to-peer communication protocol.  
- **Sacred Persistence:** Messages remain alive until delivery.  
- **Angel:** Candidate viability signal; the scout evaluating potential next-hop devices. (Takes the place of traditional “crawlers” or daemons — a deliberate inversion to emphasize enlightened, proactive network intelligence.) 
- **Angelic Army:** Set of Angels exploring paths fractally. (Replaces crawler/swarm; playful twist on typical daemon terminology. )  
- **Angel Gabriel:** Angel securing successful handoff and delivery. (Symbolizes the final, successful handoff in the network.)
- **Fractal Hop:** Phase of parallel message exploration.  
- **Singular Hop:** Minimal active payload copies after network saturation.  
- **Been-Here Flag:** Metadata preventing redundant forwarding.  
- **Handoff Protocol:** Mechanism to safely transfer payloads between devices.  
- **Swarm Intelligence Layer:** Metadata enabling AI-assisted routing and learning.  
- **Device UUID:** Unique device identifier ensuring privacy and encryption.
