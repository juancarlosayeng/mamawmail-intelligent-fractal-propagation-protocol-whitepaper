 SAMPLE ONGOING RESEARCH
## ANNEX-B Table: Projected Computational and Transmission Costs

This section quantifies the expected energy, storage, and bandwidth requirements during a full IFPP hop cycle between two devices.
The estimates are based on current-generation mobile hardware (ARM A53‚ÄìA76 class CPUs, 4 GB RAM, 10 MB/s equivalent link) and optimized cryptographic operations (SHA3‚Äì256 and XChaCha20-Poly1305).
Values are averages designed for modeling and comparative evaluation with TCP/IP message delivery.

üß© New Annex Added 

Annex A ‚Äî IFPP Message Packet Specification and Stateless Transport Behavior
Defines the three-part IFPP message structure (Ephemeral Header, AI Metadata, Eternal Message Core) and outlines stateless, no-socket transport modes via UDP, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and TCP/IP bridge.

üìò Preview:
‚ÄúEach IFPP message is composed of three interdependent yet independently storable components:
‚Äî Ephemeral Header ‚Äì transient bootstrap and authentication data.
‚Äî AI Metadata ‚Äì dynamic, self-evolving contextual information for learning and traceability.
‚Äî Eternal Message Core ‚Äì immutable encrypted payload representing the true message.‚Äù

# Submitted New IFPP Whitepaper to NLNET. 
- Separated IFPP from Mamawmail into its own Whitepaper.
<br><br>
- Github Repo about to be updated after finishing Mawmawmail Whitepaper.

UPDATED: August 24 2025

Part of the Mamawmail Research Initiative ‚Äì theoretical foundation of IFPP.
-----------------------------------------------------
## Mamawmail Research Initiative ‚Äì License Overview

The Mamawmail Research Initiative is a combined effort of theoretical research,  
system architecture design, and practical software implementation.  

It is organized into three connected repositories, each with its own license.  
The whitepapers provide the **research foundation** and theoretical framework,  
while the implementation repository translates those ideas into a working system.  

| Repository                                                | License                              | Purpose                                                   |

# mamawmail-intelligent-propagation-protocol-whitepaper
Core research and development repository for the Mamawmail system ‚Äì a decentralized, intelligent fractal propagation protocol (IFPP) for peer-to-peer communication.  Contains formal documentation, simulations, and mathematical models for message propagation, delivery assurance, and network resilience.

# Intelligent Fractal Propagation Protocol (IFPP)

üëã Welcome!  
This repository is dedicated to the **Intelligent Fractal Propagation Protocol (IFPP)** ‚Äî the "engine" behind **Mamawmail**.

---

## Why a Separate Repository?

We‚Äôve chosen to separate the work into **three focused repositories**:

1. **IFPP** (this repo) ‚Äì  
   The **core innovation**: math, proofs, comparisons with other protocols, and open simulations.  
   Think of it as the **engine** that shows *why* this protocol is different.

2. **Mamawmail-Whitepaper** ‚Äì  
   The **system-wide vision**: AI federated learning, propagation singularities, and the broader architecture.  
   Think of it as the **blueprint of the car**.

3. **Mamawmail (Implementation)** ‚Äì  
   The **working application**: community edition, enterprise modules, and integration code.  
   Think of it as the **car itself**, with parts you can drive, extend, and commercialize.

This structure avoids confusion and makes it easier for evaluators, implementers, and researchers to **focus on what matters to them**.

---

## What You‚Äôll Find Here

- üìò **Formal Papers** ‚Äì structured protocol descriptions following existing research standards.  
- ‚ûó **Mathematics** ‚Äì equations, models, and derivations behind IFPP.  
- üìä **Comparisons** ‚Äì side-by-side analysis with Email, DTN, Gossip, Spray-and-Wait, and others.  
- üé• **Animations & Simulations** ‚Äì Python templates and visualizations that make IFPP‚Äôs behavior *visible*.  
- üìö **References & Glossary** ‚Äì to align with existing work and terminology.

---

## Who Is This Repo For?

- **Researchers** ‚Äì who want to study, verify, or build upon the IFPP protocol.  
- **Implementers** ‚Äì who want ready-to-use templates for simulations.  
- **Evaluators** ‚Äì who want to clearly see how IFPP differs from traditional protocols.  
- **Contributors** ‚Äì who want to improve models, proofs, or visualizations.

---

## Final Note

This repo is not the *entire system*.  
It is **focused deliberately on the "engine"** ‚Äî where innovations can be highlighted and compared transparently.  
If you‚Äôre curious about the **whole vehicle**, please see:  
- [Mamawmail-Whitepaper](link-to-whitepaper-repo)  
- [Mamawmail Implementation](link-to-implementation-repo)  

Together, these three repositories form the complete vision of a decentralized, intelligent, and resilient communication system.
